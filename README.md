# zx81-space-shoot
 Space shooter game

Had started off as a dk88 C coding project but decided to switch back to assembly due to problems in the C to assembly
language interface (stack etc)

The main assembly file is spaceShooter.asm and this gets built into spaceShooter.p which can be loaded into a ZX81 emulator such as EightyOne
